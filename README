=============

- To initialize all servers, run the shell script launch.sh:

  $ ./launch.sh

  Individual servers can also be opened using any of the
  following commands:

  $ python blake.py
  $ python bryant.py
  $ python howard.py
  $ python gasol.py
  $ python metta.py

- To communicate with any of the servers, connect via TCP
  to localhost on any port between 12460 - 12464, using a
  client such as telnet:

  12460 -> Blake
  12461 -> Bryant
  12462 -> Howard
  12463 -> Gasol
  12464 -> Metta

  Ports 12465 - 12469 are reserved for connections between 
  neighboring proxy servers.

- Each server maintains its own log file, in the format
  <ServerName>.txt. These logs are appened to on each
  event, and are not cleared automatically on shutdown.

  To view log updates in real time, use the following
  command, for instance:

  $ tail -f Blake.txt

- To shutdown any or all servers, use any of the following
  commands (shutdown.py waits exactly one second before
  ending execution to ensure that all servers are shut down):

  $ python shutdown.py all

  or

  $ python shutdown.py blake
  $ python shutdown.py bryant
  $ python shutdown.py howard
  $ python shutdown.py gasol
  $ python shutdown.py metta

  When relaunching Howard or Bryant, please wait at least
  ten seconds before sending IAMAT or WHATSAT queries, as
  the other servers are configured to reconnect with servers
  with exponential delay with respect to time, in order
  to decrease reconnection overhead.
